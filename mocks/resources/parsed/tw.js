      text: '\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe terms “stronghold” and “fortress” both refer to places that are well protected against an attack by enemy soldiers. A “citadel” is a fortress inside a city. The term “fortified” describes a city or other place that has been made safe from attack.\n\n* Often, strongholds and fortresses were manmade structures with defensive walls. They could also have been places with natural protective barriers such as rocky cliffs or high mountains.\n* People fortified strongholds by building thick walls or other structures that made it difficult for an enemy to break through.\n* “Stronghold” or “fortress” could be translated as “securely strong place” or “strongly protected place.”\n* The term “fortified city” could be translated as “securely protected city” or “strongly built city.”\n* Another figurative meaning for the term “stronghold” referred to something that someone wrongly trusted in for security, such as a false god or other thing that was worshiped instead of Yahweh. This could be translated as “false strongholds.”\n* This term should be translated differently from “refuge,” which emphasizes safety more than the concept of being fortified.\n\n(See also: [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [refuge](../other/refuge.md), [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [2 Corinthians 10:4](rc://en/tn/help/2co/10/04)\n* [2 Kings 8:10-12](rc://en/tn/help/2ki/08/10)\n* [2 Samuel 5:8-10](rc://en/tn/help/2sa/05/08)\n* [Acts 21:35](rc://en/tn/help/act/21/35)\n* [Habakkuk 1:10-11](rc://en/tn/help/hab/01/10)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0490, H0553, H0759, H1001, H1002, H1003, H1219, H1225, H2388, H4013, H4026, H4581, H4526, H4679, H4685, H4686, H4692, H4694, H4869, H5794, H5797, H5800, H6438, H6877, H7682, G37940, G39250\n',

When a person does something sinful, it can cause him to be in a state of disgrace or dishonor.\n* Sometimes a person who is doing good things is treated in a way that causes him disgrace or shame. For example, when Jesus was killed on a cross, this was a disgraceful way to die. Jesus had done nothing wrong to deserve this disgrace.\n* When God humbles someone, it means that he is causing a prideful person to experience failure to help him overcome his pride. This is different from humiliating someone, which is often done in order to hurt that person.\n* Saying that a person is “above reproach” or “beyond reproach” or “without reproach” means that this person behaves in a God-honoring way and there is little or nothing that could be said in criticism of him.\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* Ways to translate “disgrace” could include “shame” or “dishonor.”\n* Ways to translate “disgraceful” could include “shameful” or “dishonoring.”\n* To “humiliate” could also be translated as to “shame” or to “cause to feel shame” or to “embarrass.”\n* Depending on the context, ways to translate “humiliation” could include “shame” or “degrading” or “disgrace.”\n* The word “reproach” could also be translated as “accusation” or “shame” or “disgrace.”\n* To “reproach” could also be translated as to “rebuke” or to “accuse” or to “criticize,” depending on the context.\n\n(See also: [dishonor](../other/dishonor.md), [accuse](../other/accuse.md), [rebuke](../other/rebuke.md), [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [humble](../kt/humble.md), [Isaiah](../names/isaiah.md), [worship](../kt/worship.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Peter 3:15-17](rc://en/tn/help/1pe/03/15)\n* [2 Kings 2:17](rc://en/tn/help/2ki/02/17)\n* [2 Samuel 13:13](rc://en/tn/help/2sa/13/13)\n* [Luke 20:11](rc://en/tn/help/luk/20/11)\n* [Mark 8:38](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/08/38)\n* [Mark 12:4-5](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/12/04)\n* [1 Timothy 3:7](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/03/07)\n* [Genesis 34:7](rc://en/tn/help/gen/34/07)\n* [Hebrews 11:26](rc://en/tn/help/heb/11/26)\n* [Lamentations 2:1-2](rc://en/tn/help/lam/02/01)\n* [Psalms 22:6](rc://en/tn/help/psa/022/06)\n* [Deuteronomy 21:14](rc://en/tn/help/deu/21/14)\n* [Ezra 9:5](rc://en/tn/help/ezr/09/05)\n* [Proverbs 25:7-8](rc://en/tn/help/pro/25/07)\n* [Psalms 6:8-10](rc://en/tn/help/psa/006/008)\n* [Psalms 123:3](rc://en/tn/help/psa/123/03)\n* [1 Timothy 5:7-8](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/05/07)\n* [1 Timothy 6:13-14](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/06/13)\n* [Jeremiah 15:15-16](rc://en/tn/help/jer/15/15)\n* [Job 16:9-10](rc://en/tn/help/job/16/09)\n* [Proverbs 18:3](rc://en/tn/help/pro/18/03)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0937, H0954, H0955, H1317, H1322, H1421, H1442, H1984, H2490, H2616, H2617, H2659, H2778, H2781, H2865, H3001, H3637, H3639, H3640, H3971, H5007, H5034, H5039, H6030, H6031, H6172, H6256, H7022, H7034, H7036, H7043, H7511, H7817, H8103, H8213, H8216, H8217, H8589, G01520, G01530, G04100, G04220, G04230, G08080, G08180, G08190, G08210, G17880, G17910, G18700, G26170, G30590, G36790, G36800, G36810, G38560, G50140, G51950, G51960, G54840\n',

Other Old Testament names for this city include “Salem” “city of Jebus,” and “Zion.” Both “Jerusalem” and “Salem,” have the root meaning of “peace.”\n* Jerusalem was originally a Jebusite fortress called “Zion” which King David captured and made into his capital city.\n* It was in Jerusalem that David’s son Solomon built the first temple in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, which was the mountain where Abraham had offered his son Isaac to God. The temple was rebuilt there after it was destroyed by the Babylonians.\n* Because the temple was in Jerusalem, the major Jewish festivals were celebrated there.\n* People normally referred to going “up” to Jerusalem since it is located in the mountains.\n\n(See also: [Babylon](../names/babylon.md), [Christ](../kt/christ.md), [David](../names/david.md), [Jebusites](../names/jebusites.md), [Jesus](../kt/jesus.md), [Solomon](../names/solomon.md), [temple](../kt/temple.md), [Zion](../kt/zion.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Galatians 4:26-27](rc://en/tn/help/gal/04/26)\n* [John 2:13](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/02/13)\n* [Luke 4:9-11](rc://en/tn/help/luk/04/09)\n* [Luke 13:5](rc://en/tn/help/luk/13/05)\n* [Mark 3:7-8](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/03/07)\n* [Mark 3:20-22](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/03/20)\n* [Matthew 3:6](rc://en/tn/help/mat/03/06)\n* [Matthew 4:23-25](rc://en/tn/help/mat/04/23)\n* [Matthew 20:17](rc://en/tn/help/mat/20/17)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[17:5](rc://en/tn/help/obs/17/05)__ David conquered __Jerusalem__ and made it his capital city.\n* __[18:2](rc://en/tn/help/obs/18/02)__ In __Jerusalem__, Solomon built the Temple for which his father David had planned and gathered materials.\n* __[20:7](rc://en/tn/help/obs/20/07)__ They (Babylonians) captured the city of __Jerusalem__, destroyed the Temple, and took away all the treasures of the city and the Temple.\n* __[20:12](rc://en/tn/help/obs/20/12)__ So, after seventy years in exile, a small group of Jews returned to the city of __Jerusalem__ in Judah.\n* __[38:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/38/01)__ About three years after Jesus first began preaching and teaching publicly, Jesus told his disciples that he wanted to celebrate this Passover with them in __Jerusalem__, and that he would be killed there.\n* __[38:2](rc://en/tn/help/obs/38/02)__ After Jesus and the disciples arrived in __Jerusalem__, Judas went to the Jewish leaders and offered to betray Jesus to them in exchange for money.\n* __[42:8](rc://en/tn/help/obs/42/08)__ “It was also written in the scriptures that my disciples will proclaim that everyone should repent in order to receive forgiveness for their sins.

God’s personal name is “Yahweh.”\n\n* God has always existed; he existed before anything else existed, and he will continue to exist forever.\n* He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe.\n* God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.\n* He is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.\n* People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship.\n* God revealed his name as “Yahweh,” which means “he is” or “I am” or “the One who (always) exists.”\n* The Bible also teaches about false “gods,” which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Ways to translate “God” could include “Deity” or “Creator” or “Supreme Being” or “Supreme Creator” or “Infinite Sovereign Lord” or “Eternal Supreme Being.”\n* Consider how God is referred to in a local or national language. There may also already be a word for “God” in the language being translated. If so, it is important to make sure that this word fits the characteristics of the one true God as described above.\n* Many languages capitalize the first letter of the word for the one true God, to distinguish it from the word for a false god. Another way to make this distinction would be to use different terms for “God” and “god.” NOTE: In the biblical text, when a person who does not worship Yahweh speaks about Yahweh and uses the word “god,” it is acceptable to render the term without a capital letter in reference to Yahweh (see Jonah 1:6, 3:9).\n* The phrase “I will be their God and they will be my people” could also be translated as “I, God, will rule over these people and they will worship me.”\n\n(Translation suggestions: [How to Translate Names](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names))\n\n(See also: [create](../other/creation.md), [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [God the Father](../kt/godthefather.md), [Holy Spirit](../kt/holyspirit.md), [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [Son of God](../kt/sonofgod.md), [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 John 1:7](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/01/07)\n* [1 Samuel 10:7-8](rc://en/tn/help/1sa/10/07)\n* [1 Timothy 4:10](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/04/10)\n* [Colossians 1:16](rc://en/tn/help/col/01/16)\n* [Deuteronomy 29:14-16](rc://en/tn/help/deu/29/14)\n* [Ezra 3:1-2](rc://en/tn/help/ezr/03/01)\n* [Genesis 1:2](rc://en/tn/help/gen/01/02)\n* [Hosea 4:11-12](rc://en/tn/help/hos/04/11)\n* [Isaiah 36:6-7](rc://en/tn/help/isa/36/06)\n* [James 2:20](rc://en/tn/help/jas/02/20)\n* [Jeremiah 5:5](rc://en/tn/help/jer/05/05)\n* [John 1:3](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/01/03)\n* [Joshua 3:9-11](rc://en/tn/help/jos/03/09)\n* [Lamentations 3:43](rc://en/tn/help/lam/03/43)\n* [Micah 4:5](rc://en/tn/help/mic/04/05)\n* [Philippians 2:6](rc://en/tn/help/php/02/06)\n* [Proverbs 24:12](rc://en/tn/help/pro/24/12)\n* [Psalms 47:9](rc://en/tn/help/psa/047/09)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[1:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/01/01)__ __God__ created the universe and everything in it in six days.\n* __[1:15](rc://en/tn/help/obs/01/15)__ __God__ made man and woman in his own image.\n* __[5:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/05/03)__ “I am __God__ Almighty.

      text: '\n\n## Facts:\n\nThe term “Yahweh” is God’s personal name in the Old Testament. The specific origin of this name is unknown, but it is probably derived from the Hebrew verb meaning, “to be.”\n\n* Following tradition, many Bible versions use the term “LORD” or “the LORD” to represent “Yahweh.” This tradition resulted from the fact that historically, the Jewish people became afraid of mispronouncing Yahweh’s name and started saying “Lord” every time the term “Yahweh” appeared in the text. Modern Bibles write “LORD” with all capital letters to show respect for God’s personal name and to distinguish it from “Lord” which is a different Hebrew word.\n* The ULT and UST texts always translate this term as, “Yahweh,” in agreement with the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.\n* The term “Yahweh” never occurs in the original text of the New Testament; only the Greek term for “Lord” is used, even when quoting the Old Testament.\n* In the Old Testament, when God spoke about himself, he would often use his name instead of a pronoun.\n* “Yah” is a shortened form of the name Yahweh that occurs in poetry and praise (e.g. Hallelujah = "Praise Yah"), and in some Hebrew names (e.g. Zechariah = “Yah remembers”).\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* “Yahweh” could be translated by a word or phrase that means “I am” or “existing one” or “the one who is” or “he who is present.”\n* This term could also be written in a way that is similar to how “Yahweh” is spelled.\n* Some church denominations prefer not to use the term “Yahweh” and instead use the traditional rendering, “LORD.” An important consideration is that this may be confusing when read aloud because it will sound the same as the title “Lord.” Some languages may have an affix or other grammatical marker that could be added to distinguish “LORD” as a name (Yahweh) from “Lord” as a title.\n* It is best if possible to keep the name Yahweh where it literally occurs in the text, but some translations may decide to use only a pronoun in some places, to make the text more natural and clear.\n* Introduce the quote with something like, “This is what Yahweh says.”\n\n(Translation suggestions: [How to Translate Names](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names))\n\n(See also: [God](../kt/god.md), [Lord](../kt/lord.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Kings 21:20](rc://en/tn/help/1ki/21/20)\n* [1 Samuel 16:7](rc://en/tn/help/1sa/16/07)\n* [Daniel 9:3](rc://en/tn/help/dan/09/03)\n* [Ezekiel 17:24](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/17/24)\n* [Genesis 2:4](rc://en/tn/help/gen/02/04)\n* [Genesis 4:3-5](rc://en/tn/help/gen/04/03)\n* [Genesis 28:13](rc://en/tn/help/gen/28/13)\n* [Hosea 11:12](rc://en/tn/help/hos/11/12)\n* [Isaiah 10:4](rc://en/tn/help/isa/10/04)\n* [Isaiah 38:8](rc://en/tn/help/isa/38/08)\n* [Job 12:10](rc://en/tn/help/job/12/10)\n* [Joshua 1:9](rc://en/tn/help/jos/01/09)\n* [Lamentations 1:5](rc://en/tn/help/lam/01/05)\n* [Leviticus 25:35](rc://en/tn/help/lev/25/35)\n* [Malachi 3:4](rc://en/tn/help/mal/03/04)\n* [Micah 2:5](rc://en/tn/help/mic/02/05)\n* [Micah 6:5](rc://en/tn/help/mic/06/05)\n* [Numbers 8:11](rc://en/tn/help/num/08/11)\n* [Psalm 124:3](rc://en/tn/help/psa/124/03)\n* [Ruth 1:21](rc://en/tn/help/rut/01/21)\n* [Zechariah 14:5](rc://en/tn/help/zec/14/5)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[9:14](rc://en/tn/help/obs/09/14)__ God said, “I AM WHO I AM.

      text: '\n\n## Definition:\n\nIn the Bible, the term “covenant” refers to a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.\n\n* This agreement can be between individuals, between groups of people, or between God and people.\n* When people make a covenant with each other, they promise that they will do something, and they must do it.\n* Examples of human covenants include marriage covenants, business agreements, and treaties between countries.\n* Throughout the Bible, God made several different covenants with his people.\n* In some of the covenants, God promised to fulfill his part without conditions. For example, when God established his covenant with mankind promising to never destroy the earth again with a worldwide flood, this promise had no conditions for people to fulfill.\n* In other covenants, God promised to fulfill his part only if the people obeyed him and fulfilled their part of the covenant.\n\nThe term “new covenant” refers to the commitment or agreement God made with his people through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus.\n\n* God’s “new covenant” was explained in the part of the Bible called the “New Testament.”\n* This new covenant is in contrast to the “old” or “former” covenant that God had made with the Israelites in Old Testament times.\n* The new covenant is better than the old one because it is based on the sacrifice of Jesus, which completely atoned for people’s sins forever. The sacrifices made under the old covenant did not do this.\n* God writes the new covenant on the hearts those who become believers in Jesus. This causes them to want to obey God and to begin to live holy lives.\n* The new covenant will be completely fulfilled in the end times when God establishes his reign on earth. Everything will once again be very good, as it was when God first created the world.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, ways to translate this term could include, “binding agreement” or “formal commitment” or “pledge” or “contract.”\n* Some languages may have different words for covenant depending on whether one party or both parties have made a promise they must keep. If the covenant is one-sided, it could be translated as “promise” or “pledge.”\n* Make sure the translation of this term does not sound like people proposed the covenant. In all cases of covenants between God and people, it was God who initiated the covenant.\n\n* The term “new covenant” could be translated as “new formal agreement” or “new pact” or “new contract.”\n* The word “new” in these expressions has the meaning of “fresh” or “new kind of” or “another.”\n\n(See also: [covenant](../kt/covenant.md), [promise](../kt/promise.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Genesis 9:12](rc://en/tn/help/gen/09/12)\n* [Genesis 17:7](rc://en/tn/help/gen/17/07)\n* [Genesis 31:44](rc://en/tn/help/gen/31/44)\n* [Exodus 34:10-11](rc://en/tn/help/exo/34/10)\n* [Joshua 24:24-26](rc://en/tn/help/jos/24/24)\n* [2 Samuel 23:5](rc://en/tn/help/2sa/23/5)\n* [2 Kings 18:11-12](rc://en/tn/help/2ki/18/11)\n* [Mark 14:24](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/14/24)\n* [Luke 1:73](rc://en/tn/help/luk/01/73)\n* [Luke 22:20](rc://en/tn/help/luk/22/20)\n* [Acts 7:8](rc://en/tn/help/act/07/08)\n* [1 Corinthians 11:25-26](rc://en/tn/help/1co/11/25)\n* [2 Corinthians 3:6](rc://en/tn/help/2co/03/06)\n* [Galatians 3:17-18](rc://en/tn/help/gal/03/17)\n* [Hebrews 12:24](rc://en/tn/help/heb/12/24)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[4:9](rc://en/tn/help/obs/04/09)__ Then God made a __covenant__ with Abram.

      title: '# love, beloved',
      text: '\n\n## Definition:\n\nTo love another person is to care for that person and do things that will benefit him. There are different meanings for “love” some languages may express using different words:\n\n1. The kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others even when it doesn’t benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. God himself is love and is the source of true love.\n\n    * Jesus showed this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.\n    * When people love others with this kind of love, they act in ways that show they are thinking of what will cause the others to thrive. This kind of love especially includes forgiving others.\n    * In the ULT, the word “love” refers to this kind of sacrificial love, unless a Translation Note indicates a different meaning.\n\n2. Another word in the New Testament refers to brotherly love, or love for a friend or family member.\n\n    * This term refers to natural human love between friends or relatives.\n    * The term can also be used in such contexts as, “They love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet.” This means that they “like very much” or “greatly desire” to do that.\n\n3. The word “love” can also refer to romantic love between a man and a woman.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Unless indicated otherwise in a Translation Note, the word “love” in the ULT refers to the kind of sacrificial love that comes from God.\n* Some languages may have a special word for the kind of unselfish, sacrificial love that God has. Ways to translate this might include, “devoted, faithful caring” or “care for unselfishly” or “love from God.” Make sure that the word used to translate God’s love can include giving up one’s own interests to benefit others and loving others no matter what they do.\n* Sometimes the English word “love” describes the deep caring that people have for friends and family members. Some languages might translate this with a word or phrase that means “like very much” or “care for” or “have strong affection for.”\n* In contexts where the word “love” is used to express a strong preference for something, this could be translated by “strongly prefer” or “like very much” or “greatly desire.”\n* Some languages may also have a separate word that refers to romantic or sexual love between a husband and wife.\n* Many languages must express “love” as an action. So for example, they might translate “love is patient, love is kind” as, “when a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him.”\n\n(See also: [covenant](../kt/covenant.md), [death](../other/death.md), [sacrifice](../other/sacrifice.md), [save](../kt/save.md), [sin](../kt/sin.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Corinthians 13:7](rc://en/tn/help/1co/13/07)\n* [1 John 3:2](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/03/02)\n* [1 Thessalonians 4:10](rc://en/tn/help/1th/04/10)\n* [Galatians 5:23](rc://en/tn/help/gal/05/23)\n* [Genesis 29:18](rc://en/tn/help/gen/29/18)\n* [Isaiah 56:6](rc://en/tn/help/isa/56/06)\n* [Jeremiah 2:2](rc://en/tn/help/jer/02/02)\n* [John 3:16](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/03/16)\n* [Matthew 10:37](rc://en/tn/help/mat/10/37)\n* [Nehemiah 9:32-34](rc://en/tn/help/neh/09/32)\n* [Philippians 1:9](rc://en/tn/help/php/01/09)\n* [Song of Songs 1:2](rc://en/tn/help/sng/01/02)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[27:2](rc://en/tn/help/obs/27/02)__ The law expert replied that God’s law says, “__Love__ the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind.

      text: "\n\n## Definition:\n\nA “servant” refers to a person who works for (or obeys) another person, either by choice or by force. A servant was under his master's direction. In the Bible, “servant” and “slave” are mostly interchangable terms.\nThe term “serve” generally means to do work for someone, and the concept can be applied in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n* In the Bible the words “young man” or “young woman” often mean “servant” or “slave.” This meaning will be discerned from context. One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” which could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.\n* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”\n* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often called his “servants.”\n* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”\n* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”\n* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”\n* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.\n* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.\n* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”\n* Often, when a person referred to himself as “your servant” he was showing respect to the person addressed. That person may have had higher social status, or the speaker may be showing humility. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.\n\n(See also: [enslave](../other/enslave.md), [works](../kt/works.md), [obey](../other/obey.md), [house](../other/house.md), [lord](../kt/lord.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[6:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/06/01)__ When Abraham was very old and his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man, Abraham sent one of his __servants__ back to the land where his relatives lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.\n* __[19:10](rc://en/tn/help/obs/19/10)__ Then Elijah prayed, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your __servant__.”\n* __[29:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/29/03)__ “Since the __servant__ could not pay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as __slaves__ to make payment on his debt.’”\n* __[35:6](rc://en/tn/help/obs/35/06)__ “All my father’s __servants__ have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving.”\n* __[47:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/47/04)__ The __slave__ girl kept yelling as they walked, “These men are servants of the Most High God.”\n* __[50:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/50/04)__ Jesus also said, “A __servant__ is not greater than his master.”\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* (Servant) Strong’s: H0519, H5288, H5647, H5649, H5650, H5657, H7916, H8198, H8334, G12490, G14010, G14020, G23240, G34070, G34110, G36100, G38160, G49830, G52570\n* (Serve) H3547, H4929, H4931, H5647, H5656, H5673, H5975, H6213, H6399, H6402, H6440, H6633, H6635, H7272, H8104, H8120, H8199, H8278, H8334, G12470, G12480, G13980, G14020, G14380, G19830, G20640, G22120, G23230, G29990, G30000, G30090, G43370, G43420, G47540, G50870, G52560\n",

Sometimes prayers are written down, such as when David wrote his prayers in the Book of Psalms.\n* Prayer can include asking God for mercy, for help with a problem, and for wisdom in making decisions.\n* Often people ask God to heal people who are sick or who need his help in other ways.\n* People also thank and praise God when they are praying to him.\n* Praying includes confessing our sins to God and asking him to forgive us.\n* Talking to God is sometimes called “communing” with him as our spirit communicates with his spirit, sharing our emotions and enjoying his presence.\n* This term could be translated as “talking to God” or “communicating with God.” The translation of this term should be able to include praying that is silent.\n\n(See also: [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [forgive](../kt/forgive.md), [praise](../other/praise.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Thessalonians 3:9](rc://en/tn/help/1th/03/09)\n* [Acts 8:24](rc://en/tn/help/act/08/24)\n* [Acts 14:26](rc://en/tn/help/act/14/26)\n* [Colossians 4:4](rc://en/tn/help/col/04/04)\n* [John 17:9](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/17/09)\n* [Luke 11:1](rc://en/tn/help/luk/11/1)\n* [Matthew 5:43-45](rc://en/tn/help/mat/05/43)\n* [Matthew 14:22-24](rc://en/tn/help/mat/14/22)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[6:5](rc://en/tn/help/obs/06/05)__ Isaac __prayed__ for Rebekah, and God allowed her to get pregnant with twins.\n* __[13:12](rc://en/tn/help/obs/13/12)__ But Moses __prayed__ for them, and God listened to his __prayer__ and did not destroy them.\n* __[19:8](rc://en/tn/help/obs/19/08)__ Then the prophets of Baal __prayed__ to Baal, “Hear us, O Baal!”\n* __[21:7](rc://en/tn/help/obs/21/07)__ Priests also __prayed__ to God for the people.\n* __[38:11](rc://en/tn/help/obs/38/11)__ Jesus told his disciples to __pray__ that they would not enter into temptation.\n* __[43:13](rc://en/tn/help/obs/43/13)__ The disciples continually listened to the teaching of the apostles, spent time together, ate together, and __prayed__ with each other.\n* __[49:18](rc://en/tn/help/obs/49/18)__ God tells you to __pray__, to study his word, to worship him with other Christians, and to tell others what he has done for you.\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0559, H0577, H1156, H2470, H3863, H3908, H4994, H6279, H6293, H6419, H6739, H7592, H7878, H7879, H7881, H8034, H8605, G01540, G11620, G11890, G17830, G20650, G21710, G21720, G38700, G43350, G43360\n',

      text: "\n\n## Definition:\n\nA “servant” refers to a person who works for (or obeys) another person, either by choice or by force. A servant was under his master's direction. In the Bible, “servant” and “slave” are mostly interchangable terms.\nThe term “serve” generally means to do work for someone, and the concept can be applied in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n* In the Bible the words “young man” or “young woman” often mean “servant” or “slave.” This meaning will be discerned from context. One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” which could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.\n* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”\n* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often called his “servants.”\n* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”\n* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”\n* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”\n* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.\n* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.\n* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”\n* Often, when a person referred to himself as “your servant” he was showing respect to the person addressed. That person may have had higher social status, or the speaker may be showing humility. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.\n\n(See also: [enslave](../other/enslave.md), [works](../kt/works.md), [obey](../other/obey.md), [house](../other/house.md), [lord](../kt/lord.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[6:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/06/01)__ When Abraham was very old and his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man, Abraham sent one of his __servants__ back to the land where his relatives lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.\n* __[19:10](rc://en/tn/help/obs/19/10)__ Then Elijah prayed, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your __servant__.”\n* __[29:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/29/03)__ “Since the __servant__ could not pay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as __slaves__ to make payment on his debt.’”\n* __[35:6](rc://en/tn/help/obs/35/06)__ “All my father’s __servants__ have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving.”\n* __[47:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/47/04)__ The __slave__ girl kept yelling as they walked, “These men are servants of the Most High God.”\n* __[50:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/50/04)__ Jesus also said, “A __servant__ is not greater than his master.”\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* (Servant) Strong’s: H0519, H5288, H5647, H5649, H5650, H5657, H7916, H8198, H8334, G12490, G14010, G14020, G23240, G34070, G34110, G36100, G38160, G49830, G52570\n* (Serve) H3547, H4929, H4931, H5647, H5656, H5673, H5975, H6213, H6399, H6402, H6440, H6633, H6635, H7272, H8104, H8120, H8199, H8278, H8334, G12470, G12480, G13980, G14020, G14380, G19830, G20640, G22120, G23230, G29990, G30000, G30090, G43370, G43420, G47540, G50870, G52560\n",

They are similar to his decrees, laws, or precepts.\n* “Judgment” can refer to wise decision-making ability. A person who lacks “judgment” does not have the wisdom to make wise decisions.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, ways to translate to “judge” could include to “decide” or to “condemn” or to “punish” or to “decree.”\n* The term “judgment” could be translated as “punishment” or “decision” or “verdict” or “decree” or “condemnation.”\n* In some contexts, the phrase “in the judgment” could also be translated as “on judgment day” or “during the time when God judges people.”\n\n(See also: [decree](../other/decree.md), [judge](../other/judgeposition.md), [judgment day](../kt/judgmentday.md), [just](../kt/justice.md), [law](../other/law.md), [law](../kt/lawofmoses.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 John 4:17](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/04/17)\n* [1 Kings 3:9](rc://en/tn/help/1ki/03/09)\n* [Acts 10:42-43](rc://en/tn/help/act/10/42)\n* [Isaiah 3:14](rc://en/tn/help/isa/03/14)\n* [James 2:4](rc://en/tn/help/jas/02/04)\n* [Luke 6:37](rc://en/tn/help/luk/06/37)\n* [Micah 3:9-11](rc://en/tn/help/mic/03/09)\n* [Psalm 54:1](rc://en/tn/help/psa/054/01)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[19:16](rc://en/tn/help/obs/19/16)__ The prophets warned the people that if they did not stop doing evil and start obeying God, then God would __judge__ them as guilty, and he would punish them.\n* __[21:8](rc://en/tn/help/obs/21/08)__ A king is someone who rules over a kingdom and __judges__ the people.

      text: "\n\n## Definition:\n\nA “servant” refers to a person who works for (or obeys) another person, either by choice or by force. A servant was under his master's direction. In the Bible, “servant” and “slave” are mostly interchangable terms.\nThe term “serve” generally means to do work for someone, and the concept can be applied in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n* In the Bible the words “young man” or “young woman” often mean “servant” or “slave.” This meaning will be discerned from context. One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” which could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.\n* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”\n* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often called his “servants.”\n* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”\n* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”\n* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”\n* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.\n* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.\n* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”\n* Often, when a person referred to himself as “your servant” he was showing respect to the person addressed. That person may have had higher social status, or the speaker may be showing humility. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.\n\n(See also: [enslave](../other/enslave.md), [works](../kt/works.md), [obey](../other/obey.md), [house](../other/house.md), [lord](../kt/lord.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[6:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/06/01)__ When Abraham was very old and his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man, Abraham sent one of his __servants__ back to the land where his relatives lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.\n* __[19:10](rc://en/tn/help/obs/19/10)__ Then Elijah prayed, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your __servant__.”\n* __[29:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/29/03)__ “Since the __servant__ could not pay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as __slaves__ to make payment on his debt.’”\n* __[35:6](rc://en/tn/help/obs/35/06)__ “All my father’s __servants__ have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving.”\n* __[47:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/47/04)__ The __slave__ girl kept yelling as they walked, “These men are servants of the Most High God.”\n* __[50:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/50/04)__ Jesus also said, “A __servant__ is not greater than his master.”\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* (Servant) Strong’s: H0519, H5288, H5647, H5649, H5650, H5657, H7916, H8198, H8334, G12490, G14010, G14020, G23240, G34070, G34110, G36100, G38160, G49830, G52570\n* (Serve) H3547, H4929, H4931, H5647, H5656, H5673, H5975, H6213, H6399, H6402, H6440, H6633, H6635, H7272, H8104, H8120, H8199, H8278, H8334, G12470, G12480, G13980, G14020, G14380, G19830, G20640, G22120, G23230, G29990, G30000, G30090, G43370, G43420, G47540, G50870, G52560\n",

In the Bible, “servant” and “slave” are mostly interchangable terms.\nThe term “serve” generally means to do work for someone, and the concept can be applied in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n* In the Bible the words “young man” or “young woman” often mean “servant” or “slave.” This meaning will be discerned from context. One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” which could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.\n* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”\n* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often called his “servants.”\n* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”\n* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”\n* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”\n* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.\n* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.\n* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”\n* Often, when a person referred to himself as “your servant” he was showing respect to the person addressed.

In some English Bible translations, the term “nations” is also used in this way.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* The term “people group” could be translated by a word or phrase that means “large family group” or “clan” or “ethnic group.”\n* A phrase such as “my people” could be translated as “my relatives” or “my fellow Israelites” or “my family” or “my people group,” depending on the context.\n* The expression “scatter you among the peoples” could also be translated as “cause you to go live with many different people groups” or “cause you to separate from each other and go live in many different regions of the world.”\n* The term “the peoples” or “the people” could also be translated as “the people in the world” or “people groups,” depending on the context.\n* The phrase “the people of” could be translated as “the people living in” or “the people descended from” or “the family of,” depending on whether it is followed by the name of a place or a person.\n* “All the peoples of the earth” could be translated as “everyone living on earth” or “every person in the world” or “all people.”\n* The phrase “a people” could also be translated as “a group of people” or “certain people” or “a community of people” or “a family of people.”\n\n(See also: [descendant](../other/descendant.md), [nation](../other/nation.md), [tribe](../other/tribe.md), [world](../kt/world.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Kings 8:51-53](rc://en/tn/help/1ki/08/51)\n* [1 Samuel 8:7](rc://en/tn/help/1sa/08/07)\n* [Deuteronomy 28:9](rc://en/tn/help/deu/28/09)\n* [Genesis 49:16](rc://en/tn/help/gen/49/16)\n* [Ruth 1:16](rc://en/tn/help/rut/01/16)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[14:2](rc://en/tn/help/obs/14/02)__ God had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give the Promised Land to their descendants, but now there were many __people groups__ living there.\n* __[21:2](rc://en/tn/help/obs/21/02)__ God promised Abraham that through him all __people groups__ of the world would receive a blessing.

      text: '\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe term “redeem” refers to buying back something or someone that has been previously owned or held captive. A “redeemer” is someone who redeems something or someone.\n\n* God gave laws to the Israelites about how to redeem people or things. For example, someone could redeem a person who was in slavery by paying the price so that the slave could go free. The word “ransom” also refers to this practice.\n* If someone’s land had been sold, a relative of that person could “redeem” or “buy back” that land so that it would stay in the family.\n* These practices show how God redeems people who are in slavery to sin. When he died on the cross, Jesus paid the full price for people’s sins and redeemed all those who trust in him for salvation. People who have been redeemed by God are set free from sin and its punishment.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, the term “redeem” could also be translated as “buy back” or “pay to free (someone)” or “ransom.”\n* The term “redemption” could be translated as “ransom” or “freedom payment” or “buying back.”\n* The words “ransom” and “redeem” have basically the same meaning, so some languages may have only one term to translate both these words. The word “ransom,” however, can also mean the payment necessary to “redeem” something or someone. The term “redeem” never refers to the actual payment itself.\n\n(See also: [free](../other/free.md), [ransom](../kt/ransom.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Colossians 1:13-14](rc://en/tn/help/col/01/13)\n* [Ephesians 1:7-8](rc://en/tn/help/eph/01/07)\n* [Ephesians 5:16](rc://en/tn/help/eph/05/16)\n* [Galatians 3:13-14](rc://en/tn/help/gal/03/13)\n* [Galatians 4:5](rc://en/tn/help/gal/04/05)\n* [Luke 2:38](rc://en/tn/help/luk/02/38)\n* [Ruth 2:20](rc://en/tn/help/rut/02/20)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H1350, H1353, H6299, H6302, H6304, H6306, H6561, H7069, G00590, G06290, G18050, G30840, G30850\n',

      text: '\n\n## Definition:\n\nIn the Bible, the term “lord” generally refers to someone who has ownership or authority over other people. In the Bible, however, the term is used to address many different kinds of people, including God.\n\n* This word is sometimes translated as “master” when addressing Jesus or when referring to someone who owns slaves.\n* Some English versions translate this as “sir” in contexts where someone is politely addressing someone of higher status.\n\nWhen “Lord” is capitalized, it is a title that refers to God. (Note, however, that when it is used as a form of addressing someone or it occurs at the beginning of a sentence it may be capitalized and have the meaning of “sir” or “master.”)\n\n* In the Old Testament, this term is also used in expressions such as “Lord God Almighty” or “Lord Yahweh” or “Yahweh our Lord.”\n* In the New Testament, the apostles used this term in expressions such as “Lord Jesus” and “Lord Jesus Christ,” which communicate that Jesus is God.\n* The term “Lord” in the New Testament is also used alone as a direct reference to God, especially in quotations from the Old Testament. For example, the Old Testament text has “Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh” and the New Testament text has “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.”\n* In the ULT and UST, the title “Lord” is only used to translate the actual Hebrew and Greek words that mean “Lord.” It is never used as a translation of God’s name (Yahweh), as is done in many translations.\n\n* Some languages translate “Lord” as “Master” or “Ruler” or some other term that communicates ownership or supreme rule.\n* In the appropriate contexts, many translations capitalize the first letter of this term to make it clear to the reader that this is a title referring to God.\n* For places in the New Testament where there is a quote from the Old Testament, the term “Lord God” could be used to make it clear that this is a reference to God.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* This term can be translated with the equivalent of “master” when it refers to a person who owns slaves. It can also be used by a servant to address the person he works for.\n* When it refers to Jesus, if the context shows that the speaker sees him as a religious teacher, it can be translated with a respectful address for a religious teacher, such as “master.”\n* If the person addressing Jesus does not know him, “lord” could be translated with a respectful form of address such as “sir.” This translation would also be used for other contexts in which a polite form of address to a man is called for.\n* When referring to God the Father or to Jesus, this term is considered a title, written as “Lord” (capitalized) in English.\n\n(See also: [God](../kt/god.md), [Jesus](../kt/jesus.md), [ruler](../other/ruler.md), [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Genesis 39:2](rc://en/tn/help/gen/39/02)\n* [Joshua 3:9-11](rc://en/tn/help/jos/03/09)\n* [Psalms 86:15-17](rc://en/tn/help/psa/086/015)\n* [Jeremiah 27:4](rc://en/tn/help/jer/27/04)\n* [Lamentations 2:2](rc://en/tn/help/lam/02/02)\n* [Ezekiel 18:29](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/18/29)\n* [Daniel 9:9](rc://en/tn/help/dan/09/09)\n* [Daniel 9:17-19](rc://en/tn/help/dan/09/17)\n* [Malachi 3:1](rc://en/tn/help/mal/03/01)\n* [Matthew 7:21-23](rc://en/tn/help/mat/07/21)\n* [Luke 1:30-33](rc://en/tn/help/luk/01/30)\n* [Luke 16:13](rc://en/tn/help/luk/16/13)\n* [Romans 6:23](rc://en/tn/help/rom/06/23)\n* [Ephesians 6:9](rc://en/tn/help/eph/06/9)\n* [Philippians 2:9-11](rc://en/tn/help/php/02/09)\n* [Colossians 3:23](rc://en/tn/help/col/03/23)\n* [Hebrews 12:14](rc://en/tn/help/heb/12/14)\n* [James 2:1](rc://en/tn/help/jas/02/01)\n* [1 Peter 1:3](rc://en/tn/help/1pe/01/03)\n* [Jude 1:5](rc://en/tn/help/jud/01/05)\n* [Revelation 15:4](rc://en/tn/help/rev/15/04)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[25:5](rc://en/tn/help/obs/25/05)__ But Jesus replied to Satan by quoting from the Scriptures.

      text: "\n\n## Definition:\n\nA “servant” refers to a person who works for (or obeys) another person, either by choice or by force. A servant was under his master's direction. In the Bible, “servant” and “slave” are mostly interchangable terms.\nThe term “serve” generally means to do work for someone, and the concept can be applied in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n* In the Bible the words “young man” or “young woman” often mean “servant” or “slave.” This meaning will be discerned from context. One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” which could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.\n* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”\n* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often called his “servants.”\n* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”\n* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”\n* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”\n* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.\n* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.\n* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”\n* Often, when a person referred to himself as “your servant” he was showing respect to the person addressed. That person may have had higher social status, or the speaker may be showing humility. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.\n\n(See also: [enslave](../other/enslave.md), [works](../kt/works.md), [obey](../other/obey.md), [house](../other/house.md), [lord](../kt/lord.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[6:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/06/01)__ When Abraham was very old and his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man, Abraham sent one of his __servants__ back to the land where his relatives lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.\n* __[19:10](rc://en/tn/help/obs/19/10)__ Then Elijah prayed, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your __servant__.”\n* __[29:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/29/03)__ “Since the __servant__ could not pay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as __slaves__ to make payment on his debt.’”\n* __[35:6](rc://en/tn/help/obs/35/06)__ “All my father’s __servants__ have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving.”\n* __[47:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/47/04)__ The __slave__ girl kept yelling as they walked, “These men are servants of the Most High God.”\n* __[50:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/50/04)__ Jesus also said, “A __servant__ is not greater than his master.”\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* (Servant) Strong’s: H0519, H5288, H5647, H5649, H5650, H5657, H7916, H8198, H8334, G12490, G14010, G14020, G23240, G34070, G34110, G36100, G38160, G49830, G52570\n* (Serve) H3547, H4929, H4931, H5647, H5656, H5673, H5975, H6213, H6399, H6402, H6440, H6633, H6635, H7272, H8104, H8120, H8199, H8278, H8334, G12470, G12480, G13980, G14020, G14380, G19830, G20640, G22120, G23230, G29990, G30000, G30090, G43370, G43420, G47540, G50870, G52560\n",

One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” which could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.\n* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”\n* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often called his “servants.”\n* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”\n* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”\n* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”\n* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.\n* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.\n* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”\n* Often, when a person referred to himself as “your servant” he was showing respect to the person addressed. That person may have had higher social status, or the speaker may be showing humility. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.\n\n(See also: [enslave](../other/enslave.md), [works](../kt/works.md), [obey](../other/obey.md), [house](../other/house.md), [lord](../kt/lord.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[6:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/06/01)__ When Abraham was very old and his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man, Abraham sent one of his __servants__ back to the land where his relatives lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.\n* __[19:10](rc://en/tn/help/obs/19/10)__ Then Elijah prayed, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your __servant__.”\n* __[29:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/29/03)__ “Since the __servant__ could not pay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as __slaves__ to make payment on his debt.’”\n* __[35:6](rc://en/tn/help/obs/35/06)__ “All my father’s __servants__ have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving.”\n* __[47:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/47/04)__ The __slave__ girl kept yelling as they walked, “These men are servants of the Most High God.”\n* __[50:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/50/04)__ Jesus also said, “A __servant__ is not greater than his master.”\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* (Servant) Strong’s: H0519, H5288, H5647, H5649, H5650, H5657, H7916, H8198, H8334, G12490, G14010, G14020, G23240, G34070, G34110, G36100, G38160, G49830, G52570\n* (Serve) H3547, H4929, H4931, H5647, H5656, H5673, H5975, H6213, H6399, H6402, H6440, H6633, H6635, H7272, H8104, H8120, H8199, H8278, H8334, G12470, G12480, G13980, G14020, G14380, G19830, G20640, G22120, G23230, G29990, G30000, G30090, G43370, G43420, G47540, G50870, G52560\n",
